        <h3 class="legal__title-2">Google Analytics cookies</h3>
        <p>Each time a user visits a site, Google Analytics installs an analytic cookie in his or her browser that is used strictly for statistical purposes. This cookie, which is only generated when a user visits the website, allows us to gather anonymous information concerning user activity.</p>
        <p>The anonymous identification of visitors (which involves identifying browsers and devices rather than individuals) allows administrators to determine the approximate number of people that have visited their site, and distinguish between new and returning users.</p>
