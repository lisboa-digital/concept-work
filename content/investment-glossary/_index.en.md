Large institutional investors dominate the private equity world, including pension funds and large private equity firms funded by a group of accredited investors."

    title = "Seed"
    description = "Seed financing, as the name implies, is the relatively small amount of money a business needs early on to get started. Usually businesses seeking a seed round are still in the concept stage and need just a small capital infusion to cover expenses until they can start earning revenue. Seed money can also be a helpful tool for attracting future money from bigger investors. Because seed capital is smaller and more of a high-risk investment, it generally will come from friends and family or smaller angel investors."

Though it is much more likely these investors will show up and be secured in Series A, B and C fundraising rounds than earlier."
